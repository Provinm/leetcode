#
# There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at
# station i is gas[i].
# 
# You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to
# travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with
# an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
# 
# Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit
# once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# If there exists aÂ solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
# Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
# Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
# cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
# 
# Output: 3
# 
# Explanation:
# Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 +
# 4 = 4
# Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
# Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
# Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
# Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
# Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to
# station 3.
# Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# gas  = [2,3,4]
# cost = [3,4,3]
# 
# Output: -1
# 
# Explanation:
# You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to
# the next station.
# Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 =
# 4
# Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
# Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
# You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you
# only have 3.
# Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you
# start.
# 
#
